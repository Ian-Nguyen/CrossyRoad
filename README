1.Added Checkpoint 2 Late b/c of issue with uploading to git, file size to big.
2. Professor McCarthy. Dowload only the the zips that have a 53 in their name and go into the test_world.  
I have gotten the randomization and the dynamic part of the spawning for the grass working but have not 
created a level yet, if you press play and exit repeatedly you will see that 
the props/objects will be randomly spawning and change from the previous play.  
Additionallly the tree spacing is currently still a bit off so I will have to play with that.

1. Since file size is too big and it takes for ever for git im going to put it into a google drive link.  If there are
any other solutions to this please let me know Professor Mccarthy.
2. Professor McCarthy, the entire zip is linked here https://drive.google.com/open?id=183R30tePhFZYIAkfj183PrQaw2P8AbyP.
Go into test_world and you will see that the spawning for the road and the rivers are working as generation and I am still
setting up the gamemode.
