1. Ongoing Git Portfolio
2. Professor McCarthy. Dowload only the the zips that have a 53 in their name and go into the test_world.  
I have gotten the randomization and the dynamic part of the spawning for the grass working but have not 
created a level yet, if you press play and exit repeatedly you will see that 
the props/objects will be randomly spawning and change from the previous play.

3. The Assets.zip is already put into Unreal and they are just thereas a master copy.
