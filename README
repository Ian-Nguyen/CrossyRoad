 1. Ongoing Git Portfolio
 
 5/16 Final Upload
 1. Download and unzip everything
 2. Rubric is also included, had a lot of trouble when putting all of the elements together, but individual most of the 
 components work.  Was not able to get a barrier on the side because my chicken swims. Open Test_World to test the game,
 the procedural spawning works.
 
#5/3
1.Added Checkpoint 2 Late b/c of issue with uploading to git, file size to big.
2. Professor McCarthy. Dowload only the the zips that have a 53 in their name and go into the test_world.  
I have gotten the randomization and the dynamic part of the spawning for the grass working but have not 
created a level yet, if you press play and exit repeatedly you will see that 
the props/objects will be randomly spawning and change from the previous play.  
Additionallly the tree spacing is currently still a bit off so I will have to play with that.

#5/10
1. Professor McCarthy, download only the zips that have 510 attached at the end of the name and the .uproject, the entire zip is linked 
here https://drive.google.com/open?id=183R30tePhFZYIAkfj183PrQaw2P8AbyP if there are any problems with downloading the files off git.
2. Go into test_world and you will see that the spawning for the road and the rivers are working as generation and I am still
setting up the gamemode.
